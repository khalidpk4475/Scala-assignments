/*
A trait encapsulates method and field definitions, which can then be reused by mixing them into classes.
 Unlike class inheritance, in which each class must inherit from just one superclass, a class can mix in
 any number of traits.

Traits are used to define object types by specifying the signature of the supported methods.
Scala also allows traits to be partially implemented but traits may not have constructor parameters.

A trait definition looks just like a class definition except that it uses the keyword trait.
